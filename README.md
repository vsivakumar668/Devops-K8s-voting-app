**Cloud-Native Web Voting Application with Kubernetes**

This cloud-native web application is built using a mix of technologies. It's designed to be accessible to users via the internet, allowing them to vote for their preferred programming language out of six choices: C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, Java, and NodeJS.

**Technical Stack**

**Frontend**: The frontend of this application is built using React and JavaScript. It provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for casting votes.

**Backend and API**: The backend of this application is powered by Go (Golang). It serves as the API handling user voting requests. MongoDB is used as the database backend, configured with a replica set for data redundancy and high availability

**Kubernetes Resources**

To deploy and manage this application effectively, we leverage Kubernetes and a variety of its resources:

**Namespace**: Kubernetes namespaces are utilized to create isolated environments for different components of the application, ensuring separation and organization.

**Secret**: Kubernetes secrets store sensitive information, such as API keys or credentials, required by the application securely.

**Deployment**: Kubernetes deployments define how many instances of the application should run and provide instructions for updates and scaling.

**Service**: Kubernetes services ensure that users can access the application by directing incoming traffic to the appropriate instances.

**StatefulSet**: For components requiring statefulness, such as the MongoDB replica set, Kubernetes StatefulSets are employed to maintain order and unique identities.

**PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim**: These Kubernetes resources manage the storage required for the application, ensuring data persistence and scalability.


**Learning Opportunities**

Creating and deploying this cloud-native web voting application with Kubernetes offers a valuable learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:

Containerization: Gain hands-on experience with containerization technologies like Docker for packaging applications and their dependencies.

Kubernetes Orchestration: Learn how to leverage Kubernetes to efficiently manage, deploy, and scale containerized applications in a production environment.

Microservices Architecture: Explore the benefits and challenges of a microservices architecture, where the frontend and backend are decoupled and independently scalable.

Database Replication: Understand how to set up and manage a MongoDB replica set for data redundancy and high availability.

Security and Secrets Management: Learn best practices for securing sensitive information using Kubernetes secrets.

Stateful Applications: Gain insights into the nuances of deploying stateful applications within a container orchestration environment.

Persistent Storage: Understand how Kubernetes manages and provisions persistent storage for applications with state.

By working through this project, you'll develop a deeper understanding of cloud-native application development, containerization, Kubernetes, and the various technologies involved in building and deploying modern web applications.
